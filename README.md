# License Plate Detection 

This repository hosts a deep learning model for license plate detection from images, using TensorFlow and Keras. It employs a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model and data augmentation for improved accuracy. Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/license-plate-detection.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd license-plate-detection
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python3 license_plate_detection.py
```

Ensure to replace `/path/to/your/dataset` with the actual path to your dataset directory in the `license_plate_detection.py` script before running it.

## Customization

You can customize the data directory, data augmentation parameters, and the architecture of the dense layer added to the base model within the script.
